        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Efrain Banales Jr and I am a first year at University of California, Riverside. I am working on my bachelors degree in business economics. Specifically, I am trying to obtain a Bachelors of Arts in Finance with a minor in computer science or a minor in religious studies. I am proud to be here at UCR, forging my journey to greatness with the help of the school to be my guidance. I am a first generation student in my family so it is a blessing and a new experience for me getting a higher education at such a school like University of California, Riverside.<br><br>

        I was born in the United States and have lived in Riverside, California my whole life. I went to Ramona High School here in Riverside for all four years of my high school education. I am dedicated my time during high school to get the best grades that I could. I have always been interested and good at math so that was one of the best subjects that I performed in. One of the hardest things that I had encountered with math was the AP tests for AP Calculus AB and BC. This was due to the fact that there was a lot of hours of practicing math problems and nights staying up to do so. I believe that I can accomplish whatever I put my mind to and to support that, I passed both of the AP Tests with a four. <br><br>

        Some achievements that I have received in high school were honor roll and perfect attendance for all four years that I was in high school. I managed to go to school everyday and make sure to never miss a day since I am very serious about my education. I am very focused on whatever obstacle or journey that is presented upon me and make sure to always try to complete the task to the best of my abilities. Another skill that I have is teamwork and leadership. I can either lead or work as a team to get something done and make sure that the team is working as efficiently as possible.
